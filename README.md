1. What the Website Is: 

The **Local Skills Hub** is an online directory where people in your community can post their **skills or services** so others can find and hire them.

Think of it like a digital noticeboard for:

* Plumbers, carpenters, tailors
* Photographers, makeup artists
* Teachers, tech experts, and more

2. Who Can Use It

* Service Providers (people offering skills) — they post their details.
* Service Seekers (people looking for help) — they browse and contact providers.
* You (Admin) — you control what shows on the site.

3. Step-by-Step How It Works

A. Admin Login

1. You open the website and log in with your admin password.

   * The first time you use it, you set your password.
2. Once logged in, you see the Admin Dashboard where you can manage all listings.


B. Posting a Skill (Provider’s Side)

1. A service provider visits the submission page.
2. You can fill in:

   * Name
   * Email
   * WhatsApp Number
   * Type of Service (e.g., Plumber, Makeup Artist)
   * Description of what they do
   * Photo (optional — like their work or profile picture)
3. You can submit the form — the data is saved inside the website’s storage (LocalStorage).



1. Anyone visiting the homepage can see all approved listings.
2. Each listing shows:

   * Name
   * Service type
   * Description
   * Contact buttons:

     * Email → opens your email app to send them a message.
     * WhatsApp → opens a chat with them directly.
       
3. If you uploaded an image, it’s displayed — clicking the image opens it full-screen for better viewing.


4. Why It’s Useful

* It works without a backend** (cheaper, faster).
* It’s easy for locals to post and find services.
* No need for technical knowledge to run it — just open the HTML file in a browser.
